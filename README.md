# Object-Detection-Model
- In this project, I Perform Object detections with a pretrained model with the KerasCV Object Detection API.
- Object detection is the process of identifying, classifying, and localizing objects within a given image. Typically, your inputs are images, and your labels are bounding boxes with optional class labels. Object detection can be thought of as an extension of classification.
- The highest level API in the KerasCV Object Detection API is the keras_cv.models API. This API includes fully pretrained object detection models.
- Project Steps: First we Import Packages, then Perform detections with a pretrained model. Next we load an image.
- After that Just like any other keras.Model you can predict bounding boxes using the model.predict() API.
